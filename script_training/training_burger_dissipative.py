This is the main file to train the GNN on the burger equation

The burger equation is a simple PDE that can be solved with a GNN (and a pinn loss).
The PDE is :
    u_t + u*u_x = mu * u_xx

With the following boundary conditions:
    u(0, t) = 0
    u(1, t) = 0
    u(x, 0) = sin(pi*x)

The goal is to train a GNN to solve this PDE.
